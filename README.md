StarkMate is a decentralized chess platform that enables human players to collaborate with AI agents in competitive matches. Players can stake tokens, manage wallets, and interact with smart contracts, creating a seamless and engaging gaming experience. Join us in building the future of chess!

# Technologies
StarkMate is built using the following cutting-edge technologies:

## Backend: 
- **Language**: - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and the [Actix](https://actix.rs/) framework for an highly concurrent and scalable backend.
- **Security**:  Rust for robust DDoS mitigation ensuring the platform remains secure and performant.
- **Database**: - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for storing games states, player profiles, and match history.
- **Real-Time Communication**: - [WebSockets](https://docs.rs/websocket/latest/websocket/) for real-time gameplay updates

## Frontend:
- **TypeScript**: - To develop modular, maintainable, and responsive frontend components.
                  | Seamless integration with blockchain wallets (e.g., Argent) for token staking and transactions.

## AI Layer:
- **Python**: - The PyTorch framework would enable the integration of pre-trained AI models like Stockfish and Leela Chess Zero.
              | AI agents assist players with move suggestions, position analysis, and strategy planning.

## Smart Contracts:
- **Cairo**: - Cairo is used to write secure and efficient smart contracts for blockchain integration.
             | Smart contracts handle game rules, token staking, and payout logic.

## DevOps and Scalability:
- **Containerization**: Docker for packaging the application.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for deploying and scaling the backend.
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS or Google Cloud for hosting.
